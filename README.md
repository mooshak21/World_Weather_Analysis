# World_Weather_Analysis
This project is broken up into 3 deliverable where we go over the following

## Deliverable 1 (Weather_Database folder)
1. Making an API call
2. Creating a config.py file with API keys
3. Retrieving city weather data with the OpenWeather API
4. Adding the weather data to a DataFrame
5. Export the DataFrame to a CSV file

## Deliverable 2 (Vacation_Search folder)
1. Adding the weather data from our previous csv to a DataFrame
2. Adding the config.py file to the .gitignore file to avoid people using our API keys
3. Creating input statements for a hypothetical user
4. Filtering a DataFrame using the loc method to get specified columns
5. Retrieving hotel data using the Google Places API
6. Adding data to a pop-up marker with descritors of the location
7. Creating a marker layer map

## Deliverable 3 (Vacation_Itinerary folder)
1. Using similar techniques from deliverable 2 but with the Directions API
2. Overall goal was to make a vacation itinerary for someone based on a start and end destination with stops along the way.
